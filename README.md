# hello-world
Trial for my very first time using GitHub. I have done some data analysis project and I want to save my documentaries here in GitHub. In this repository, I will share a little bit about my journey as data analyst.
I start doing data analysis since I was a Head of Business Department of Kopma UNY. It was about 7 years ago. At first, I used to doing data analysis with Ms. Excel as my data analysis tools. Until in 2023, I start using MySQL and Python as my analysis tool.
